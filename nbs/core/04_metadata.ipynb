With millions saying they would like to work \\nshorter hours, and millions of others without a job or wanting more hours, \\nit’s essential that we consider how we address the problems in the labour \\nmarket as well as preparing for the future challenges of automation.”\\nJohn McDonnell, Labour Shadow Chancellor\\n“This report is part of an important and growing body of research that \\nis steadfastly putting paid to the idea that the length of the working \\nweek is set in stone. It’s increasingly clear it is not. In fact, as this report \\ndemonstrates, working less may actually be the key to better distributed, \\nsustainable economic prosperity. Whether the 4th industrial revolution \\nand its implications for the future of labour happen as many predict or \\nnot, the issue of catastrophic climate and ecosystem breakdown is real \\nand upon us now. The science tells we have around a decade to take \\nradical action. Fail to do so and the implications for global civilisation \\nare grim. Working fewer hours, reducing consumption for its own sake, \\nexpanding our free time, improving ourselves and moving towards a \\nmore post-material society maybe all that stands between a prosperous \\nfuture and a dark, dystopian one.”\\nClive Lewis MP, for Norwich South\\n“This report clearly puts forward the case for a shorter working week as \\na realistic ambition, and the critical role of trade unions in helping to \\nachieve it. From the eight-hour day to guaranteed bank holidays, the \\ntrade union movement has always stood up for working people’s right to \\ntake time off. This report will help us to keep winning for workers in the \\n21st century.”\\nKate Bell, Head of Rights, International, Social and Economics at \\nthe TUC (Trades Union Congress)\\n“Workers in the UK have never been under more pressure to work harder \\nand faster, for longer hours and for less. As this report underlines, \\nwith growing levels of workplace stress and a huge increase in mental \\nhealth issues, this simply isn’t a sustainable path and we need a radical \\nchange in direction. We have to get away from a low-investment, low-\\npay, low-productivity economy and a shorter working week should be \\nat the heart of the fight for change. This is not a distant prospect – the \\nCommunication Workers Union has agreed a shorter working week in \\nRoyal Mail, one of the biggest employers in the country, which aims to \\ntake four hours off the working week thousands of postmen and women \\nbetween 2018 and the end of 2021. There are huge benefits from \\nreducing working time for workers, employers and the country as a whole \\nand the government should be driving this agenda forward now.”\\nDave Ward, General Secretary of the Communication Workers’ \\nUnion (CWU)\\nThe Shorter Working Week: Jan 20194\\nAutonomy'"
